## Project Description
- The goal of this project is to develop a service that can reduce the information gap between experts and consumers within the outsourcing platform.
- The client company is in a situation where customers are continuously leaving for other companies in the overheated outsourcing platform market.
- This is because the information gap between customers exists, and they are not able to receive appropriate prices.
- Therefore, a process is needed to specify the expert service provided using the LLM model and then provide an appropriate transaction price.
- The repository provides a crawling code that collects expert service data from the Kmong platform and a model code that classifies the subcategories of services using KoBERT.
